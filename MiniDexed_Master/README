This program is a USB to serial MIDI adapter. It connects to an USB host via the
USB connector of the Raspberry Pi Pico on one side and to a MIDI device with
serial interface via GP0 (UART TX)/GP1 (RX) on the other side. MIDI
messages/events, received on one side, will be converted and send out on the
other side. The LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico board flashes, when MIDI data is
exchanged.

If you enable the #define IGNORE_MIDI_CC in the file main.c, the MIDI control
change and program change events, which have be received from the USB host, will
be filtered out and ignored.

MiniDexed itself is build in a Debian WSL on my Windows machine
